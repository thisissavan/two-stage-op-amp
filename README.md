## Design of two-stage-op-amp

This project contains the design of a two-stage op-amp with high gain and phase margin using Cadence Virtuoso software. Design steps are mentioned below:

- Using the specification, design parameters for each transistor are found.
- Schematic of the design is made keeping in mind that all transistors are in saturation.
- Various parameters are measured and reported.
- Checked for all process corners and 30 Monte Carlo runs successfully.
- After reaching the desired measurements, the layout of the design is done.
- DRC and LVS clean are achieved.
